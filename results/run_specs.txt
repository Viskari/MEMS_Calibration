--Back from holidays. Change limits for aN, g, gN, pH, aH, th1, th2. Change starting values for aN, w1, w2, w5, g, gN, pH, aH, th1, th2.

Runs #145-146: Global run with new limits and starts, DEzs and DREAMzs
SPECS: iter=1500k, chains=3
-DEzs converges around 900k
-DREAMzs does not totally converge
-DEzs results are slightly shifted for most parameters compared to #143. Most notably, aN and bN1 are totally different (aN is forced lower by new limit).

--Change logic for humus - now litter bags have zero humus generation (pH = 0)

Run #147: Global run with new humus logic, new limits and starts.
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results converge
-Compared to #145:
--pWN slighly shifted
--likelihood is slightly worse overall
--rmse is slightly better overall

Run #148: CIDET run with new humus logic, new limits and starts.
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results converge
-Compared to #124 (different limits):
--The results are very similar, even with totally different limits
--Overall likelihoods are similar too

Run #149: LIDET run with new humus logic, new limits and starts.
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-bN2 and gN do not converge, everything else does
-Compared to #127 (different limits):
--There are similar convergence issues for bN2 and gN. Data related?
--Generally, the results are very similar

Run #150: ED run with new humus logic, new limits and starts.
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Surprisingly, results very nearly converge (g-r = 1.23). aA, aW, aE have most trouble.
-Compared to #130 (different limits):
--Results now converge, clear improvement in that sense
--Otherwise difficult to compare since #130 is all over the place
	
Run #151: Repeat #147 with DREAMzs
SPECS: DREAMzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Messy mixing and not fully converging. As usual for DREAMzs.

Run #152: Repeat #147 with AM
SPECS: AM, iter=1500k, chains=3
-No convergence, as expected, chains get stuck to local optima

--Found a bug in M채kinen data, initial values were ordered incorrectly

Run #153: Repeat run #154 with AM
SPECS: AM, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results are similar to #152, as expected
-Ordering got messed up here, run #154 should have been before run #153

Run #154: Global calibration with fixed M채kinen data.
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results converge and are very similar to #147 (global with bugged M채kinen).
-Suggests that the bug in M채kinen data had minor influence on the results.

Run #155: Repeat run #154 with DREAMzs
SPECS: DREAMzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results are similar to #151, as expected

Run #156: Global calibration with the added Hob3 dataset.
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-The calibrated leaching parameter for Hob3 was chosen to be w3.
-Results are similar to #154
-Suggests that adding Hob3 does not significantly impact the calibration

Run #157: Repeat #154 with sequential logic
SPECS: DEzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results similar to #154, as expected
-Sequential logic seems functional

Run #158: Repeat #155 with sequential logic
SPECS: DREAMzs, iter=1500k, chains=3
-Results similar to #155, as expected
-Sequential logic seems functional
